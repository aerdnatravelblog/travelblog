###Transportation

If you go from Cartagena and you want to travel cheap take collectivo (small bus that stops anywhere) for 1.800 COP to bus terminal which is one hour drive from the center. In the bus terminal ignore hustlers and any friendly advisors and go straight to the counters. Ask for direct bus to Santa Marta. We went with Berlinave for 20.000 COP p.p. in a bus with AC and a toilet.
