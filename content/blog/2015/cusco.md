Before we went to Cusco, we had spent three days in the Urubamba district with a couchsurfing host and his girlfriend. We loved being in the nature again, cooking, eating, relaxing and talking with them about the alternative life style. The house is in a remote area, close to a river. One night, when we were having dinner, Andrea asked if there are any snakes around, as she is very scared of them. 
Petra told me, that there are snakes, but she haven't seen many. The spiders are another story. She pointed out the black widow, a poisonous insect. Then we changed the theme and we started to talk about old Inca ruins around. They found their houses in this area as well. Petra told us that many of her visitors had very weird dreams the first night sleeping in her house. Maybe the spirits of the Incas are still present:) We don't believe in such a thing so we finished our drink and went sleep.
I remember that I really had one of the weirdest things ever and it felt very real. The dreams were about my country, Czech Republic. They were saying me that if I come back I will be in a trouble. I haven't lived there almost for three years and I am not planning to come back in the near future. I was rolling in the bed from one side to another like someone would have chasing me. Then I felt something on my leg. I thought that it is my pajama so I turned again. But then I realized, what if it is not the pajama! I opened my eyes, stopped to breath and jumped out of the bed. There was a huge spider, big like a fist walking under the blanket. 
They say the bigger spider is less poisonous then the smaller one. But who knows. But what was this all about will stay for me a mystery.

## About

Cusco was the capital of the Inca empire. Most of the tourists coming to Peru visit Cusco and nearby Inca ruins. Many of the colonial houses are built from the ancient Inca ruins stones. They say that in Cusco doesn't exist one colonial house which wouldn't be built out of that. The city center is very beautiful but we enjoyed it even more at night because there was less traffic.
Unfortunately like almost every city in South America, the air is very polluted by cars emissions and smog. And you have to fight the high altitude as the city is 3400 m above the sea level. We were short on the breath almost all the time and we didn't get used. Even after one week we had problems with it, coca tea helps a bit and we didn't have any headaches or stomach problems. When you will see the city in the night, the illuminated old monuments and cobblestone streets and hear the horn of train heading to the ancient Machu Pichcu you get the feeling of amazing spiritual atmosphere. You will forget about all your health issues and the smog as well.

## Attractions

We recommend to spend at least five days, we stayed one week. The first day relax and try to eat good, drink a lot of water if you are not used to the altitude yet. Buy the full Cusco tourist ticket "Boleto turistica del Cusco", with that you can visit 16 sights. It is valid for ten days and costs 130 PEN (39 USD). We have to warn you that most of the museums aren't worth it, but all of the Inca ruins do. By the way, the entrance prices have rosed recently and the admission to most of the sights you would have to pay 70 PEN so if you visit 2 sights the ticket already pays off. There will be two more monuments, Moray and Ollantaytambo in the next article.
We advise you to find informations about the sight on internet and downloaded it as offline documents to the Google drive like we did. You can read it on your smart phone then. Or buy a good guide book, there are no informations about the the monuments. We ordered the list of the monuments by the significance and subjective opinion how much did we like 
it.

### Saksaywaman

You can find this ancient complex in the north skirts of Cusco. The area was occupied from 9th century by Killke culture. We were amazed by the huge stones perfectly fitting to the construction. It took them to bring some of them one year. Saksaywaman is very high up the hill in the elevation of 3700 m above the sea level. It woke our curiosity up, how did they do it? They needed at least one hundred men to track the stone up there. The complex was covered by gold. Unfortunately all the gold was stolen by the Spaniards. We were just imaging how big the citadel was before they started to taking it apart. If it would preserve till nowadays, it would be even greater then Machu Picchu. Not to be missed while in Cusco.

### Pisac

Go to the street Puputi and catch some of the busetas. They leave when they are full so better to go in to the fuller one if you are in hurry. Otherwise you can wait also for one hour. It costs about 6 PEN p.p. When in Pisaq, visit their handcraft market. They have amazing stuff, we can't buy anything as we alredy bought a hammock and a blanket at Otavalo market in Ecuador. We don't suggest you to buy anything big as the post fee is very high everywhere in South America, even in Bolivia. Then you have to take a taxi if you don't want to walk up hill 8 kilometers. Find buddies and share 50 PEN at least between four people. We tried to bargain, but this time we didn't win. The ruins are spread in a large area, plan at least four hours to explore it. And if you don't want to pay another 50 PEN and another one hour and half more for descending back to Pisac. We took the Inca path, it was fun and it allowed us to explore more of the ruins.

### Tipon

These ruins are located 30 km south from Cusco. We didn't go from Cusco, but we found on internet that you can go with micro bus from Av. De La Cultura 1320, the direction to Urcos. Please verify this information. Again you have to take a taxi to get up the hill to these ruins, we paid 10 PEN and on the way back 6 PEN, prices are after bargaining. We highly recommend to connect the visit with visiting the ruins of the ancient city of the Killke culture, Piquillacta. The certain purpose of the ruins is unknown. We were amazed by the structure and shape of the agriculture terraces. When you climb a bit up the hill it looked like a boat. Aside are located temples and another buildings and also very long canal which was bringing the water to the terraces. It has few kilometers. Two hours are enough for this sight.

### Pikillaqta

It is not easy to get here from Tipon, you have to take few busetas. ....These ruins of Wari empire are very large but as they are very old (550-1100 A.D.) they are not well preserved. It was a city and they are saying that they used to drink lot of beer and chicha. So we took a stroll throw their city and we were imaging Wari drunk people on the square and in the streets.

### Monumento Pachacuteq

Located on Av. Sol, you can not miss this huge bronze statue of the Inca ruler. As you are ascending the eight floors of the monument, you get a lot of informations about him and the times when he used to rule. The Inca empire was very developed and rich in that times. He managed to put the empire together. We also enjoyed the view after dawn from the top.

### Museo Historico Regional

As we said visiting most of the museums included in the "Boleto Turistico" is wasting of your precious time. This one is an exception. It is located near Plaza Francisco, in Calle Heladeros. It won't inform you just about the Inca culture but also about the prehistoric times when all area of Cusco was under water. In the second floor we enjoyed a projection about Tupac Amaru II. who was very brave warrior who wanted to liberate Peru from Spaniards. And he really managed to deliberate Cusco, at least for a while. His death was more then tragic, they tied his legs and arms to four horses who were then driven at once toward the four corners of the square.

## Food
To our surprise we were eating mainly in vegetarian restaurants in Cusco as they are plenty of them. And they are very cheap and good. 

### Green Point

This was our favorite restaurant in Cusco. We came almost every day for Menu del Dia. For 12 PEN you get free salad bar, soup, main course, desert and juice. We were amazed by the quality and how the vegies used for their meals were fresh and delicious. And it wasn't just about regular rice and beans what you can find in many vegetarian restaurants, they are very creative and work with You can find this restaurant in the district San Blas, Carmen Bajo 235. They are opened every day, except Sunday, from 8:00 till 22:00.

### Choco Museum

The entry is for free and it is worth the visit. The design is very nice and modern and you get really good idea about how the chocolate is made. Defenitely visit the cafeteria, we recommend Aztec Chocolate (with chili powder and honey) and brownie. Everything had a taste out of this world. We paid for two hot chocolates and two cakes 38 PEN. You can find these Chocolate Museums also in Lima or Ollantaytambo. Adress:Calle Garcillaso 210, Cusco

### Where to stay

Kurumi hostel

Big advantage of this hostel is that it is located in a quiet are but very close to the city center. However you have to walk up hill every time. The rooms are spacious and for a double room with a private bathroom we paid 66 PEN per night. There is also free coca tea and breakfast included. The breakfast is pretty basic with bread, marmalade, fruit and coffee or tea. We were pretty happy with this hostel, just one thing we have to add. We had from the second day problems with smell, coming probably out of the canals. But what I've heard it is pretty common in Cusco. The stuff was very nice and stored our backpacks for few days when we were doing Machu Picchu for free. Adress:Calle Arco Iris 488.
