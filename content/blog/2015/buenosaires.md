### Free walking tour

The afternoon tour
There are at least four different companies doing free walking tour in Buenos Aires. We decided to go with BA free tour and we were very happy with out guide Vicky. She was very knowledgeable and funny, we got lot of informations on what happened with Evita Perron body or on how the rich people used to live in the palaces. It is a big shame that Perron privatized most of the palaces and let them built modern buildings instead. There used to be more then 130 palaces, now there just 38. The tour takes you to the districts Retiro and Recoleta. They call Recoleta the Paris of South America. There is a good reason for it, almost everything in this district was brought from Europe and in that time was the style number one French Belle Epoque. You will find lot of fashion stores, design shops and beautiful cafeterias. Recoleta is the most expensive neighborhood in BA, together with Puerto Madero. The afternoon one what we did, starts at 5 pm at Santa fe Ave and Maipu st. beside the monument, Monday to Saturday.

The morning tour
starts at 11 AM at Rivadavia Ave and Rodriguez Pe√±a st., Monday to Saturday

### El Ateneo Grand Splendid

Guardian wrote about this bookshop in Buenos Aires that is the second most beautiful bookshop in the world. We have to say with certainty that this bookshop is the most beautiful what we've ever seen. It is placed in an old theater and besides buying books you can also sit down and read them or have a coffee in their cafeteria. We really liked this activity and it is for free:) However the books seemed overpriced. Address:Av. Santa Fe 1860, BA
