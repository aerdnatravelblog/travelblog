We were very excited about the Death Road. We chose very carefully our company, we wanted a great experience and we didn't want to spend lot of money. Not an easy thing to manage. On the end we chose Mayhem. They had really good reviews, but some people were complaining that on the end of the tour (after they did the downhill) they had too much fun. Is this even serious complain? Better to say, the other people from their groups had too much fun:) We don't have anything against it and we love beer so we decided to join them. What a great decision! The guide was so entertaining, playing us cool music the whole time in a car, making jokes and doing tricks with his bike. 
Then came a moment when he absolutely shocked us. We were taking pictures when we saw a jump on the edge of the road. The jump was made just out of dirt. Probably we don't have to remind you that the road is about 400 meters high and there is almost nothing to catch you if you fell down, except few trees when you are very, very lucky. Between the jump and the road was a gap. When he was picking up speed, we almost didn't breath. He came on the jump and we saw that he had to lift the bike because the jump wasn't stable at all. He made it, what a relieve. He knew what he was doing and could react in a hundredth of second, professional.
And yes, we got drunk after the ride a bit and what's wrong with that? We just survived the Death Road!

## About

La Paz is the capital city of Bolivia. No it is not:) Don't worry,almost everybody think so. They even taught Andrea this on the school, but the true is that the capital is Sucre. However the government is in La Paz. Nuestra Senora de La Paz is, at least in our eyes, much more developed and metropolitan then Sucre. 
We recommend you to don't plan anything requiring too much physical activity on the first day. Drink a lot of water and coca leaf tea. The city is located in about 4.000 meters above the sea level (different elevations). 
We visited the city in the first half of October and the weather conditions were pleasant. In the day we had sun and in the night a bit cold but one sweater was enough. 
About the security, we've heard so many stories from other travelers but nothing happened to us and it felt pretty safe. However, be careful with taxis and in the bars keep an eye on your drink all the time.

## How to get to La Paz from Puno

We took an early bus at 7:00 am from the bus terminal with company Tour Peru for 60 PEN p.p. The bus was comfortable and they took us to the borders as well. 
This crossing of boarders was the worst in our trip. We were waiting for one hour and half in a long queue on Peruvian side. You can also change your PEN for BOB here. There are dozens of ladies sitting in their tiny offices (just a small table and a chair). They gave us good rate. 
Then we crossed the bridge and got to the Bolivian side where was even longer queue. We spent more then two hours in this one. 
The ride to La Paz is spectacular, go in the day it is worth it. However, if you are in rush it is usually much faster to cross the borders in the night. You can also chose a ride through Copacabana with a stop in this beautiful village on the coast of lake Titicaca. 
The ride should take 6 hours, but it took 9 hours because of the borders. You can also buy your tickets online:

## Attractions

### The Death Road

The Yungas road starts in high elevation 3.600 meters above the sea level and leads to tropical Coroico in the Amazon jungle.
This is the attraction number one when in La Paz. If you are in good physical condition, not to be missed! We went with Mayhem and we were more then happy. We were group of six people which is in our opinion perfect. When we saw another, much larger groups, we were thinking how the guide can possibly observe and take care about all of these guys. 
They picked us up at 9:00 am with a private transport in our hostel. In one hour we were at the highest point of the tour, 4.700 meters, where we got our bikes. The guide let us to ride a bit and try our skills. He also explained us how to behave on the road and answer our questions. We got helmet, knee and elbow pads and a jacket. 
The first part of the ride is super easy, you just go downhill on nice smooth road for almost an hour. You can admire mountain peaks and valleys bellow. After this we had a snack including eggs and some sweets which we very appreciated because the second party is not easy. We also bought our tickets for the Yungas park, they are not included in the price. 
After a short ride in a van we started to ride on the Yungas road (the smooth new road continues on the other side of the valley). The road gets sometimes very narrow and the surface is rough, full of rocks. We went pretty fast downhill most of the time so we were very happy that we have very good bikes with hydraulic brakes. When somebody got a flat bike, our guide called our driver, who was all the time somewhere close to us and he repaired the wheel in few minutes.
He was also taking pictures of us and making videos what we got right after the tour in the office. The helmets had an extension where we could put our go-pro cameras. We had our camera in the car so on every stop we could take it and make pictures of the amazing views of the valley. 
When we passed the waterfalls we started to feel the change of the climate. It was very warm and pleasant. 
The tour ended in the Coroico where we had a lunch and shower. Then we were free to swim in a pool and drink beers. We had great time all day long and we will never forget about this adventure, full of adrenaline. 
We made reservation of the tour on their website and paid with on-line with credit card. The price is 70 USD p.p. excluding the entrance fee 25 BOB to the Yungas park. It was very good option from the cheaper companies doing this tour. Gravity, the most famous and popular company, charge 150 USD and they have larger groups. We can not recommend Mayhem enough!

### The city center

We won't lie, we partied a lot in La Paz and we didn't do so much sightseeing of the city. We took a stroll through the colonial historic center and tried to visit the metro cable, but it was closed. We liked the main square Plaza Murillo and surrounding narrow streets. Another attractions are 
Lucha Libre de Cholitas - every Sunday you can see fighting women in their traditional costumes, wrestling style. 
The Witches Market -  Calle Linares between Sagarnaga and Santa Cruz. You can find that sort of stuff like llama fetus or dried frogs.

## Food
We found many nice restaurants in La Paz, most of them with foreign cuisines. The Bolivian food is similar to the Peruvian food, you can find Chifa restaurants, BBQ beef hearts (anticuchos) or Salchipapa. We also visited Peruvian food festival in La Paz, which was for free but with slightly higher prices and definitely not so good like original Mistura festival. 

### Vinapho

We love Vietnamese food and we were craving a bowl of Pho soup for long time. You can choose medium or big size of the soup and different types of meat. Andrea chose the vegetarian version and Igor the classic beef Pho. The soup was very well seasoned with lot of crunchy veggies. We would just appreciate more herbs. We tried also spring rolls, very delicious. It is not cheap restaurant, but the quality is very good. We were also very happy with the service, that spoke English with Igor and Spanish with Andrea and was very helpful with the menu. For two Pho's, four spring rolls and drinks we paid 130 BOB.

### Chez Moustache

In this restaurant you can enjoy fine dining. The prices are high, so the quality of the food. We chose Steak Tartare and duck breasts with orange sauce from the menu. The steak was very good, well seasoned but it was accompanied with French fries. A salad end toasted bread how we eat it in Europe is much better option. The duck was absolutely delicious and juicy, nothing to complain about. The service was very nice and recommend us good Bolivian wine. We paid 250 BOB.

## Nightlife

There are plenty of clubs in La Paz. The thing is, that many of them are very touristy and that is the last thing we are looking for. In Bolivia they like beer, a lot. Their traditional drink is called Singani and is made out of grapes, like Pisco in Peru. But it has different taste then Pisco, stronger but not in a good way. It is allowed to smoke almost everywhere.

### Diesel Nacional
The design of the club is very interesting, everything is made out of recycled metal. Even the toilet. They offer mixed drinks, beers and food. It is very popular with the locals and the prices are slightly higher. Good spot where to start the night.
Address:Av.20 de Octubre, La Paz, Bol√≠vie

### Route 36

This bar open after eleven o'clock is visited just by tourists. Ask the taxi drivers, they know the way. Be prepared for higher prices. We read that you have to pay a lot of money on the entrance and to the taxi driver. For us was different, maybe because we don't look rich and we speak Spanish. We met lot of crazy people and we were surprised of pretty good music what they played there. However, nobody wasn't dancing, just talking:)

## Where to stay

### Landscape B&B

We weren't supposed to stay in this place. It would be too much expensive for us. We chose cheaper hostel of this company, closer to the downtown. They mixed up reservations and didn't have space for us. They offered us this bed and breakfast and we bargained the price with them. We couldn't be better then in this place. Everything was very clean and stuff was very kind and spoke good English. In the bathroom was amazing hot and strong shower. We had beautiful views of the city from 12th floor. Just the breakfast wasn't great and the dishes were often dirty. What a shame in such a beautiful apartment...


Address:Arce Ave. and Pinilla St.- Arcadia Building, 12th Floor. Sopocachi Central, La Paz City Centre
