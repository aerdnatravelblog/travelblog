On our first day in Banos, we decided to rent a buggy and explore the area. In the office they recommended us to visit the waterfalls. We were very excited about the trip, so we jumped right into the buggy and went for a ride. We passed by two beautiful waterfalls. Each time we parked our rented buggy, made some pictures, started the engine again and left. That wasn't the case when we visited the fourth waterfall. We got into a line of cars passing underneath the waterfall and we couldn't get back or park it. The only way is to go through the waterfall. We got a serious splash of water which was fun. Totally wet but happy we drove off to watch people doing bungee jumping from a bridge. We parked and shot some pictures, but then we realized that our three hours rent will be soon over and still we haven't seen Pailon del Diablo, the biggest waterfall. So we went back to our buggy, turned the key... and nothing happened. Obviously the water got into the motor starter. Thanks god, some nice guy appeared and showed us how to start by shortcutting the starter in the back with a piece of metal. Because Igor was driving he taught me (Andrea) how to do it. Each time when we wanted to start, I had to open the lid of the starter and do the trick, which raised the attention of the locals, watching us with curiosity.

## About

Banos - the bathroom of Ecuador. The city is located in the center of Ecuador at the foot of the Tungurahua volcano. It is popular with tourists because of the variety of adrenalin sports. You can do kayaking, zip lining, rafting, cycling, bungee jumping, rent a buggy, ATV or motorcycle. You can also explore the close volcano or the famous "Swing at the End of the World" at Casa del Arbol.

## How to get to Banos

We went to Banos after visiting Cotopaxi volcano, near Latacunga. In this case you have to go trough Ambato, the bus ticket costs 1.50 USD. From Ambato to Banos the bus costs 1.15 USD. The journey takes at least about three hours.

## Attractions

### Waterfalls

There are about 14 waterfalls in Banos to explore, many of them very high. As we described above, we rented a buggy in Banos and we've seen four of them. We were pushed by the three hours renting time, which cost us 45 USD. We wanted to rent it for the whole day, but this was the maximum. All companies have the same prices and they are not keen to give discounts, but try anyway. They gave us a map of "Ruta de las Cascadas", the map of waterfalls. Until the Pailon del Diablo you drive on the main road, along the River Pastaza, direction to Puyo city. There are signs for each waterfall. First we saw the small waterfall Agoyan. We continued to the waterfalls of Manto de la Novia. Very impressive, you can use the zip line cabin to get across and see it from closer distance. The most amazing and powerful waterfall is Pailon del Diablo. The entrance is 1.50 USD, for so little money you can get close and even behind the waterfall, shower included. We saw rainbows as well, really spectacular and not to be missed in Banos!

### Zip lining

There are many places to do zip lining in Banos and we did a lot of research on it. We chose the 
"Imagine Ecuador" travel agency. They offer zip lining in Puntzan, one of the longest in Banos. We really liked, that you had to do small hikes between the 6 zip lining tracks. On each zip line you try different styles like superman, upside down or sitting. If you are a couple or with a friend, you will appreciate the tandem zip line. It is a cool experience, as you can see in our youtube video. It costs 20 USD p.p. and includes the transport. This was definitely one of our favorite attractions in South America.

### Hot springs

After a long, adventurous day, we appreciated the hot springs. There are a dozen luxurious places that you can choose from, but the cheapest and most common option is to use the public spa. "Las Piscinas de La Virgen" spa is located close to the city center, to the left of the big waterfall. They are open early in the morning from 5 am till 5 pm and in the evening from 6 pm. The entrance fee is 3 USD. There are two levels. On the ground floor is a hot pool (around 40 degrees). On the second floor is a warm pool and larger cold pool. You can also have a shower in the waterfall, very cool. The warm pool is always packed, you can barely move. We spent most of the time in the hot pool, sitting on the edge of the pool with legs dipped in the water. You must wear a silly swimming cap. You can buy them on the way to the spa, from one of the local merchants.

## Food

Banos is a small, touristic city and the quality of the local restaurants was a bit of a disappointment. But there are some good options, which we would like to point out to you.

## Market
Eating on the local market is always a good option. We had the best Encebollado soup for 2.50 USD. We tried a local specialty "Yahuarlocro", a soup from potatoes, meat and blood. Also delicious was "Llapingachos" (3 USD), a simple meal that consists of potato tortillas, chorizo, eggs, avocado, salad and of course the ever present rice:) Try fresh juice at the juice stalls from "zanahoria y manzana" carrot and apple, it's cheap and good for your hangover. 

### Carpe Diem di Verdi
This is the only restaurant that we can really recommend in Banos. They bake good pizza and calzone. The taste of the pastry was close to what we are used to from Europe. With 2 USD for a slice of pizza or empanada, it's a bargain. Only downside was, that it had closed twice we went for dinner and lunch.

##Where to stay
### Hostal Ca単alime単a

We were satisfied with this hostel. For 20 USD, we got a nice double room with a private bathroom, hot water, comfortable bed, TV and fast internet. The location is 5 minutes walking distance from the center and far from the loud bars and discos. The staff is very nice and helpful. There is a kitchen that can be used by guests.
