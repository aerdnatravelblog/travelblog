On our first day in Banos we decided to rent a buggy and explore the area. In the office they recommended us to visit the waterfalls. We were very excited about the trip so we jumped right into the buggy and went for a ride. We passed by two beautiful waterfalls. Each time we parked our rented buggy, made some pictures, started the engine again and left. That wasn't the case when we visited the fourth waterfall. We got into a line of cars passing underneath the waterfall and we couldn't get back or park it. The only way is to go through the waterfall. We got a serious splash of water which was fun. Totally wet we went to see people doing bungee jumping from a bridge. We parked and started to explore a bit but then we realized that our three hours rent will be soon over and still we haven't seen Pailon del Diablo, the biggest waterfall. So we ran to our buggy in rush, turned the key..and nothing happened. Obviously the water got into the engine. Thanks god, some nice guy appeared and show us how to start. Because Igor was driving he taught this method Andrea. So every time when we wanted to start, Andrea had to open the lid of a battery and put for a second something from metal and the buggy started to work again. Otherwise we could just push the buggy (Andrea pushing and Igor sitting.) You can imagine that the locals had good laughs looking at us.

##About

"Banos, the bathroom of Ecuador". The city is located in the center of Ecuador at the foot of the Tungurahua volcano. It is popular with tourists because of the variety of adrenalin sports in the jungle. You can do kayaking, zip lining, rafting, cycling, bungee jumping, rent a buggy, ATV or motorcycle. You can also go to explore the close volcano or swing above the valley at Casa del Arbol.

##How to get to Banos

We went to Banos after visiting Cotopaxi volcano, near Latacunga. In this case you have to go trough Ambato, the bus ticket costs 1.50 USD. Then from Ambato to Banos the bus costs 1.15 USD. The journey takes at least about three hours.

##Attractions

###Waterfalls

There are about 14 waterfalls to see in Banos, many of them very tall. As we described above, we rented a buggy in Banos and we've seen four of them but there is more to see. We were pushed by the three hours of rent time, the cost was 45 USD. We wanted to rent it for whole day, but this was the maximum. All companies have the same prices and they are not keen to give a discount, but try anyway. They gave us a map of "Ruta de las Cascadas", the map of waterfalls. Until the Pailon del Diablo you drive on the main road, along the River Pastaza, direction to Puyo city. There are signs for each waterfall. First we saw small waterfall Agoyan and then we continued to the waterfalls Manto de la Novia. Very impressive, you can use the zip line cabin and see it from closer distance. The most amazing and powerful waterfall is Pailon del Diablo. The entrance is 1.50 USD, for so little money you can see the waterfall from very close distance and get wet. We saw rainbows as well, really spectacular and not to be missed when in Banos.

###Zip lining

There are many places to do zip lining in Banos and we did a lot of research on it. We chose company Imagine Ecuador. They offer zip lining in Puntzan, one of the longest in Banos. We really liked that it contains also some hikes between and there are 6 routes so it isn't over just in one minute. As there are more routes, you can try different styles like superman, upside down or sitting. If you are a couple or with a friend, you will appreciate one route where you can fly next to each other, choose the style superman! It costs 20 USD and it includes the transport. One of our favorite attractions in South America.

###Hot springs

After long adventurer day we appreciated the hot springs. You can choose from public places like we did or you can go for more luxury options. "Las Piscinas de La Virgen" are located close to the city center. They are open early in the morning from 5 am till 5 pm and then in the evening from 6 pm. The entrance is 3 USD. There are two floors. On the ground floor is a hot pool (around 40 degrees) and in the second floor is a warm pool and larger cold pool. You can also have a shower in the waterfall, very cool. Only one downside is that the warm pool is always packed, you can barely move. Most of the time we spent in the hot pool, sitting around with legs dipped in the water and chatting. Buy a bath hat before in one of the shop on the way there.

##Food

Banos is a small city and very touristic so we had a big problem to find something good.

Market
You never can go wrong with eating on the market. Especially when they have so great Encebollado soup for 2.50 USD. Or local specialty Yahuarlocro, a soup from potatoes, meat and blood. Okay we didn't try that one but we tried Llapingachos (3 USD), a simple meal that consists of potato tortillas, chorizo, huevo, avocado, salad and of course rice:) Then buy a juice from "zanahoria y manzana" carrot and apple. 

Carpe Diem di Verdi
This is the only one restaurant what we can really recommend in Banos. They bake good pizza and calzone. The taste of the pastry is the closest the ones what we are used to from Europe. And it is cheap, about 2 USD a portion of pizza or empanada. Only downside is that we tried to go two times then and every time was closed. 

##Where to stay

Hostal Cañalimeña

We were very happy with this hostel. For 20 USD we got nice double room with private bathroom. Hot water, comfortable bed, TV and fast internet. Location is also good 5 minutes walking to the center, enough far from loud discos. The staff is very nice and helpful.
