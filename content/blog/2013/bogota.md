Most of the art collection in this museum was donated by the famous columbian artist Fernando Botero. This musem is for free and it houses also a numismatic museum. Botero has a very distinct style and you might find that he is obsessed with painting fat people, but the truth is all of his objects are voluminous.

Botero has said about his figures, “What I say is that they are not fat, but voluminous. If I make a fruit, a landscape, an animal, a man, anything, it is a deformation to exalt volume. So I do not see them as fat, but as voluminous. Fat can also be Michelangelo, Masaccio or all Florentine art that is voluminous.”

Besides of Boteros paintings and sculptures  you can admire paintings from Picasso, Gustav Klimt, Max Ernst, Joan Miro, Salvador Dalí and many more.
