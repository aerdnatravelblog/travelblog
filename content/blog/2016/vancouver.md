summary=When we were planning our trip to B.A. we didn't know that we will stay with one of the coolest and relaxed persons what we've ever met. Pato approved our request on Couchsurfing and we were in contact with him since then. 
description=The capital city of Argentina has a lot to offer, great nightlife, food, culture events, beautiful center with amazing history and much more. You will need at least four days but we spent in B.A. more then one week and it wasn't enough. The architecture is stunning , you will feel like in European city, maybe like in France, Italy or Spain.
