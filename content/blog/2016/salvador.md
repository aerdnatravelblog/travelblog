When we arrived to Salvador we didn't know almost anything about the city. We heard from many people, how is the city dangerous and ugly. Again, we were surprised, because anything from that was truth. At least for us. It was safe to walk around in the night or even early morning hours. Of course it is not the prettiest city ever, although it was very charming. When we were imaging Brazil in our dreams, it looked like this. Very hot weather, women dressed in colorful dress, beaches, coconut water and other fresh fruit, groups of Capoeira dancers and musicians, smiley and happy people and beautiful blue sea around. The smells, the colors and the noise of the city were very intensive. 
On the top of that, we spent our time with a local in his house, surrounded by his friends and other Couchsurfers. Every day we went for a party to the city center to drink Caipirinhas, smoke cigars and try to dance samba with locals. We spent just short time with Melek, but it was unforgettable experience. 
Don't listen to the people who say that there is nothing to see in Salvador and just go.

## How to get to Salvador

We got stuck in Florianopolis because of bad weather so we decided to buy a flight ticket to Salvador and spend some time on a beach. It wasn't really cheap. However, if we would buy it in more advance it could be cheaper. We bought a flight ticket from Sao Paulo. dopsat kolik to stalo

## About Salvador

Salvador is one of the oldest city in America. Founded by Portuguese in 15th century. The beautiful colonial city center called Pelourinho is listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site. Salvador was also the first capital city of Brazil. The urban beach Porto da Barra was awarded as the 3rd world best beach by the Guardian newspaper. 
The city is divided in two parts, upper (cidade alta) and lower city (cidade baixa). They are connected by Elevador Lacerda (0.15 BRL one way), enjoy the view of the city from the upper part. When we descended with the elevator we also visited the Mercado Modelo. Nothing special about it, lot of souvenirs and tourists. 
In front of the Mercado is a bus stop, where we took a bus to the Porto da Barra beach. 
The city center, Pelourinho (cidade alta) is also the center of nightlife and restaurants. 
Every year takes the biggest street party place in Salvador da Bahia, the Bahian Carnival. The Carnival starts one week before the Ash Wednesday (52 days to Easter). More then 2.5 million of people celebrate and dance in the streets. We are very sorry that we can not attend the Carnival this time.

If you want to get a bit out from the city, go to Praia Flamengo. We really like this beach, in our opinion nice then Porto da Barra.

## Food in Salvador

There is plenty of street food in Bahia. Try acaraje, a fried ball made out of peeled beans filled with shrimps, ground cashew, chili and green peppers, yummy! Fresh coconut water cost just 3-4 BRL (less then a dollar). 

### Handburger

We went to this restaurant after spending whole day on a beach, drinking beers with friends. This was absolutely perfect remedy for hangover. The meat was fresh and juicy and fries were crispy. Prices were alright, considering the quality of the food-24 BRL for a small hamburger and 32 for a big one, fries included0. Probably one of the best burgers what we've tried in Brazil. 

Address:Avenida Almirante Marques Le√£o, 293, Barra, they are opened from 17:00

### Pysco

They have quite good food and really good handcrafted beers. Menu ejecutivo cost us 29 BRL (8 USD), it consisted from an appetizer-we ordered bruschetta and salad, and a main course-we tried fish and steak.Steak wasn't really good, but the appetizers and fish were tasty. 

Address:Ladera Do Carmo 7- Santo Antonio, Pelourinho

# Morro de Sao Paulo

We loved Morro de Sao Paulo so much that we stayed there for the rest of our trip. We spent three weeks in this paradise. We recommend you to reserve at least five days for this gorgeous place.

## How to get to Morro de Sao Paulo from Salvador

You have two options, more expensive and faster or slower and cheaper one. The expensive option is go to the ferry terminal close to Mercado Modelo and take a catamaran to Morro for 80 BRL (20 USD)-2 hours ride. We decided for the cheaper option, as always. 
First we went to Sao Joaquim ferry terminal. From there we took a ferry to Bom Despacho for 4.5 BRL (1 USD), it took one hour. Then we took a bus to Valenca for 20 BRL (5 USD), it took 2.5 hour to get to the city. From Valenca we took a speed boat for another 20 BRL to Morro, that took just 40 minutes. We saved almost half of the expenses.

## About

Morro de Sao Paulo is located on the north of Tinhare island. No cars are allowed on the island so you have to walk or take a boat to move around. The beaches are very clean with almost white sand and crystal clear blue water. The beaches are signed as numbers, 1st beach, 2nd beach - the most touristy, 3rd and 4th beach - more quiet and relaxed.

## Attractions

### Boat trip

Every tourist office is offering this trip, usually it cost 100 BRL (25 USD). We bought the trip from a guy on the 2nd beach for 70 BRL. It starts at 9 am and it doesn't include any food or drinks. There are six stops. On first and second stop we visited natural pools, where we could do snorkeling or just relax in the crystal clear calm water and drink beer from a floating bar. After that we visited a beach whyere the sea meets with river, the sand was extremely fine and white. Then we stopped at a floating restaurant where we bought fresh oysters. The oysters were very delicious and they had also good cocktails on the bar. The price for 12 oysters was 20 BRL (5 USD). We came back at 5 pm, it was truly amazing day.

### Snorkeling

We rented snorkels in a shop on the second beach for 10 BRL (2.5 USD), they recommended us the 3rd beach as a good location to see fish. We didn't see many fish but we saw a lobster anSd another creatures. The water on 3rd and 4th beach is very, very warm. We spent whole day under the water without a problem. 

### Gamboa

Gamboa is a small village close to Morro. It is possible to reach the village on foot, but just when the tide is low (usually in the morning). Take the same direction as for the restaurant Dice 10, just don't turn left and continue straight ahead. After a while you will see direction signs. It is very beautiful 30 minute hike around the beaches. The water in Morro is more calm and there are no corals so you can swim easily. Stay in the Por do Sol restaurant and order Octopus Moqueca, it was the best Moqueca what we've tried in Brasil (70 BRL). The restaurant-bar is located on the beach.
After all day spent on the sun we took a boat leaving from the Gamboa beach back to Morro for 5 BRL (1 USD).

## Food

Surprisingly, we found plenty of good restaurants in this small village. And it was even cheaper then in Salvador.

### Dice 10

This was our favorite restaurant, the dishes were always tasty and prices unbeatable, 18-25 BRL for a main course. The service was very good, attentive, nice and professional, Argentinians are the best!:) Try their steaks, fish or calamari. You can not do a mistake, because we tried everything and we didn't complaint once. They are opened just for lunch and then dinner (from 6 pm). It is a bit difficult to find this restaurant. When you are on the main square, coming from the beach, continue straight (under an arch) to Caminho da Lagoa. Then after the fountain turn left and the restaurant will be on your right.

### Papoula Culinaria Artesanal

This restaurant is on the same street as Dice 10, just continue the street more further and it will be on your right side. The price range is almost the same as Dice 10 and they are opened from 12 am to 22 pm every day, except Sunday. We really like the fish on orange sauce, crab (siri) and their Fillet Mignon. They have also pizza, which is not bad and excellent juices. 

### Restaurante Bella Vida

If you want to eat Moqueca, come here. It was one of the best Moqueca that we've tried in Brasil. The chef is Italian, however we didn't try any pasta dishes. Moqueca is a fish or sea food stew, very popular in Brazil. Usually it is for two people to share. The stew is cooked in coconut milk with coriander, tomatoes, garlic and onion. In Salvador we saw prices around 80-100 BRL, in Bella Vida we paid 55 BRL. The second time we also tried this amazing BBQ shrimps.
You can find this restaurant on the 3rd beach.

## Where to stay

### Pousada Passarte

We had great time in this pousada....dopsat!

## Nightlife

We heard so much about great nightlife in Morro de Sao Paulo. We love this place, but believe us, the nightlife is not really good. There are regular parties on the 2nd beach on Mondays and Thursdays for free. They play typical Brazilian music and the sound system is very bad. However, we went every Thursday and we had fun, drinking Caipirinhas and talking with locals and tourists. 
Then we did the biggest mistake and went to Disco Pulsar, which was terrible idea. The shittiest international music was played by local dj's and everything was expensive. So was the entrance, 100 BRL. 
We also visited Toca, located on the viewpoint. The music was nice, they played deep house. However, the cocktails weren't good and they were expensive. The service was very bad, waiting time for one drink at least 30 minutes. We had to pay 10 BRL to enter the club.

We really liked the lounge located close to the port (on the left side, last bar before entering the pier). They have really strong Caipirinha, we didn't have to pay any entrance and they played cool house music. Come there for sun set, it is spectacular.
