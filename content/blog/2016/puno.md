Before we went to Puno to see Titicaca lake, we had decided that we want to see Uros floating islands and people living there. We booked the tour in our hostel. Half an hour after that, we boarded on a small boat and left Puno. 
After we arrived to the first island, local people welcomed us in traditional costumes and accompanied us to their cottages. They offered us their traditional dress and make photos with them. When we asked about their style of life, we got just short answers without further explanations and we were dragged to their market to buy their handcrafted goods (some of them obviously made in a factory). After we spotted a solar panels and plastic bottles, we were sure that this is everything but not traditional. Just show for tourist. On the end they were singing songs in Spanish and English. The globalized world is crazy.

## About

Puno is located on the shore of Lake Titicaca. The city itself is not worth the visit. The streets are noisy and full of cars. Everybody is here coming to see the floating islands and the infamous lake. If you have time, go to Copacabana, the Bolivian side. Unfortunately we didn't have the option, but from the bus window the lake looked nicer then on the Peruvian side.

## How to get to Puno

There are overnight buses going from Arequipa. On the terminal they told us that the ride will take six hours. We got nightmare experience with Julsa company. It took ten hours, as the bus got broken on the way and we had to wait one hour for another bus. In the second bus was freezing cold. Other passengers were complaining that with this company are just problems. Take enough warm clothes and don't go with the cheapest company. It cost us 60 PEN (17 USD)

## Attractions

### Uros islands

This was the only tour we had time for in Puno, as we rushed to La Paz and then to Sucre to start our Spanish course. It was very easy to arrange, we paid 25 PEN (7 USD) in our hostel and they picked us up with taxi and brought us to the Puno harbor. When the boat was full we left to the floating islands. 
After we arrived we got some explanations on how the people are creating the islands and about their style of life. The floating island is built from totora reed which is growing in this area. The floor can be five meters wide. As the reeds on the bottom rot, the new ones have to be added constantly. They build also two floor boats out of the reeds. Bcause of the strong wind, they need to be pushes by motor boats:) They have also their own school and hospital. 
The first island was quite fun, we spend some time with the locals but we couldn't get rid off the feeling that we shouldn't be there, spoiling their culture. On the other hand, because there is almost no fish in the lake anymore, the tourism is the only thing what is helping these people to survive. Otherwise they would have to go to live in to the city and there wouldn't be any floating islands at all.

## Food

### Loving Hut

We really enjoyed the food here. Vegetables were fresh and tasty, so were the juices. Very healthy and cheap food. We tried quinoa and pumpkin soup. Go for the lunch menu, it is a bargain. For a dinner for two with two juices we paid 70 PEN (20 USD). Address: Pasaje Choquehuanca 188, Puno.
