Visiting the Iguazu waterfalls isn't cheap. The bus ticket cost much more then tickets to other destinations in the same distance from B.A.. The food and drinks in the city and especially in the park are pricier then elsewhere. And then there is the entrance to the park. We were trying to save money on food, so we bought a piknik instead of eating in a restaurant.
The park is full of animals, Nasua among them. They are very used to people and they come very close. We were talking with a Danish couple, not paying attention to our food on the table. All of a sudden a Nasua jumped on the table and grabbed whole package of cookies. We were starring at him for a while and then Igor...

## How to get to Puerto Iguazu from Buenos Aires

We tried to bargain the price with many companies on the Retiro station. There are dozens of them, but we heard everywhere the same. The normal price is about 1100 ARS (74 USD) and they can give us the best price with just small discount, 960 ARS (64 USD). On the counter of Tigre Iguazu we finally got a bit better price, 850 ARS (57 USD). 
The road goes through a jungle and it is very bumpy. We didn't get much sleep. It took 18 hours.

## About

The city is located 18 km from the waterfalls. We did a lot of research before we planned our trip and because we didn't have much time and money we could decide just for one side of the waterfalls, the Argentinian. In Argentinian side is much more to do then in the Brazilian side. However, Puerto Iguazu is just a small city, bigger Brazilian city Foz do Iguazu has probably more to offer.  
The waterfalls are one of the world's largest waterfalls and they are listed between Seven natural wonders in South America. They shouldn't me missed when visiting Brazil. 
Before we went to Puerto Iguazu, we read from different bloggers how the place is expensive. For example five days visit of the waterfalls cost some ladies 1000 USD and they considered it being cheap. It is possible that we just got lucky and Argentina was very cheap in the time of our visit. Now the new government will make changes, so check please the actual prices before you go.

## The Iguazu waterfalls

They extend over 2,700 meters, there are 275 falls that create Iguazu Falls, “Devil’s Throat” is the tallest at 80 meters in height. It is absolutely impressive to see how powerful nature can be, standing close to them. 
The natural park is quite extensive so keep whole day for the visit of the Argentinian side. You can even visit the park twice, the second day you have 50% discount on the ticket. There are different trails, leading to the waterfalls. We did the upper (1400 meters) and lower circuit (1750 m). The lower circuit is more interesting. However if you don't like hiking there is also a train, going around the park and it is for free. After the upper circuit we went with the train to see the Devil's throat, the most impressive part of the park. You get very wet there, so take a rain coat or spare clothes to change afterwards. 
There is possibilities to do boat trip and get wet directly under the waterfalls. The prices start on 350 ARS. The day we visited the waterfalls wasn't good weather and was raining so we decided to not do and save money. The San Martin island was closed due the bad weather conditions.
The bus to the waterfalls cost 50 (3.5 USD) ARS each way and took 40 minutes. You can take the bus from the terminal or from any station on the main road leading to the park. The entrance to the park was in December 2015, 260 ARS (17 USD).

## Food

### La Dama Juana

We wanted to celebrate our two years anniversary so we picked this nice restaurant. We were very surprised by the quality of the food and wine. We paid about 100 ARS (7 USD) for a dish (steaks), 50 ARS (3.5 USD) for starter (jungle salad with mango) and 80 ARS (5.5 USD) for a bottle of Malbec. The meat was juicy and tender, pink inside. The atmosphere is cozy, they have life musicians in the evening. They are opened every day.

## Where to stay

### El Guembe Suites

We got spacious double room with terrace for 23 USD per night. Breakfast was included. The staff speaks English and they are helpful. We slept good in the night. However, the bathroom could be cleaner. The hostel is located little bit further from the city center, but the bus station is pretty close. 
Address:Tarefereros 119, Puerto Iguazú
