When we were planning our trip to B.A. we didn't know that we will stay with one of the coolest and relaxed persons what we've ever met. Pato approved our request on Couchsurfing and we were in contact with him since then. He asked us to bring some nice beer for him from Bolivia. So we already knew that we will find common language.
When we arrived we just left our backpacks in his house and we went to buy meet, vegetables and beers for "Asado", Argentinian styled BBQ. Andrea just started to get used to Argentinian access, it wasn't easy at all after being so long in Peru and Bolivia where is very easy and understandable Spanish spoken. Igor was totally lost in conversations, but it didn't matter because all people in his house were always very friendly and funny so after few beers he could communicate easily:) Every day we were waking up in good mood, perhaps because all people around us were in good mood as well. 
We were talking till late night, drinking beers and eating the most delicious meat. Can you imagine better vacation and way how to experience Argentinian way of life?
Now we think that Argentinians are the best people in the world! Sorry, our Spanish and Italian friends, they are beating you just because of the Asado:)
Once when Argentina will make it out of the economic crisis, we will be more then happy to come to live there. To Buenos Aires, the best city!

## How to get to Buenos Aires from Mendoza

We bought our tickets already in the bus terminal in Salta, where we got 30% discount from Via Bariloche company. We paid about 650 ARS (instead of 960). The trip takes 13 hours.

## About

The capital city of Argentina has a lot to offer, great nightlife, food, culture events, beautiful center with amazing history and much more. You will need at least four days but we spent in B.A. more then one week and it wasn't enough. The architecture is stunning , you will feel like in European city, maybe like in France, Italy or Spain. There is a reason for that, 10 millions of immigrants came to Buenos Aires from these countries in 19th century. They brought materials, decorations and furniture from Europe. It happened when in Europe was very popular style Belle Epoque. Thanks to that you will find multicultural mix of people with great taste for culture, music and food.
When you arrive to the city, buy the Sube card for 10 ARS (0.66 USD) and charge it. The prices of the public transport vary, from 2.25 ARS for train to 3.5 ARS for some buses and metro. For us the central point was the Retiro station, there you will find metro, trains (to districts Palermo and La Paternal), buses (to La Boca or Puerto Madero) and you can also easily walk to Florida street where you can change you dollars (The Blue market), which is located in the city center. Recoleta and its famous cemetery is also in the walking distance from Retiro. We like to walk a lot and it's for free.
The weather is pretty unstable in the low season, when we came it was just 16 degrees and one day was raining without stop. Another days we were getting a lot of sun and it was very hot.

## Attractions

### Free walking tour

## The afternoon tour
There are at least four different companies doing free walking tour in Buenos Aires. We decided to go with BA free tour and we were very happy with out guide Vicky. She was very knowledgeable and funny, we got lot of informations on what happened with Evita Perron body or on how the rich people used to live in the palaces. It is a big shame that Perron privatized most of the palaces and let them destroy and built modern buildings instead. There used to be more then 130 palaces, now there just 38. The tour takes you to the districts Retiro and Recoleta. They call Recoleta the Paris of South America. There is a good reason for it, almost everything in this district was brought from Europe and in that time was the style number one French Belle Epoque. You will find lot of fashion stores, design shops and beautiful cafeterias. Recoleta is the most expensive neighborhood in BA, together with Puerto Madero. The tour starts at 5 pm at Santa fe Ave and Maipu st. beside the monument, Monday to Saturday.

## The morning tour

We were very lucky that our guide was again Portena Vicky (people from Buenos Aires are called Portenos) She took us from the Palacio Congreso, one of the most beautiful buildings in the city, through Av. Mayo, where we could admire beautiful colonial buildings. Look up and admire the amazing architecture. We really liked the Palacio Barolo remaining the Divine Comedy from Dante Alighieri. The bottom part of the building should remain hell and the upper part, the paradise. The reason why they built this palace was to bring the the body of Dante Alighieri. They never achieve it. Now Maestro rests in Italy, where in our opinion also belongs. However, the building is stunning and you can also eat in a restaurant in the upper part and have a nice view of the city. Unfortunately you have to pay entrance (150 ARS). On the tour you will also see Casa Rosada (the Government) and the Obelisk. The tour takes four hours, so be prepared to walk a lot.
Starts at 11 AM at Rivadavia Ave and Rodriguez Peña st. (in front of the Congress), Monday to Saturday.

### El Ateneo Grand Splendid

Guardian wrote about this bookshop in Buenos Aires that is the second most beautiful bookshop in the world. We have to say with certainty that this bookshop is the most beautiful what we've ever seen. It is placed in an old theater and besides buying books you can also sit down and read them or have a coffee in their cafeteria. We really liked this activity and it is for free:) However the books seemed overpriced. Address:Av. Santa Fe 1860, BA

### San Telmo

This is the oldest neighborhood in Buenos Aires and shouldn't be missed. The district is well known for art galleries, museums and tango halls. We enjoyed the market, cozy cafeterias, antiques, bookshops and shopping in design shops.  It's recommended to visit the market on Sunday, when it extends to downtown. We visited La Boca before we went to San Telmo (It's possible to walk the distance). If you don't like tourist scam, overpriced souvenirs and tons of tango dancers asking you to make a cheesy photo with them, don't stay long at La Boca. To get to La Boca, take a bus from Retiro.

### Palermo

Palermo is the biggest neighborhood in Buenos Aires. We enjoyed especially the Bosques de Palermo, huge park where you can also visit a botanic garden. We loved to take a stroll and have a rest from the hectic city center. This district is well known for its restaurants, bars and great nightlife. Pay a visit to Palermo Soho, Bohemian district, you can find it between Av. Santa Fé, Córdoba, Scalabrini Ortiz and Juan B. Justo. 

### Recoleta cemetery

Perhaps one of the most beautiful cemeteries in Argentina, if not in whole South America. You can find the graves of Evita Perron, granddaughter of Napoleon, presidents or high military officers. The admission is free and the cemetery is opened from 7:00 till 17:00 every day.

## Food

### Santos Manjares

This was our favorite restaurant in B.A. They specialize at steaks and they do it very well. We ordered the Rump steak in BBQ sauce and Fillet Mignon and bottle of wine. They have menu del dia as well, but we ordered the dishes from menu. The meat was very tender and sauces delicious. We recommend more the Rump steak. Prices are more then reasonable. We paid around 100 ARS per steak (6.6 ARS).
Address:Paraguay 938, City center, close to Av. 9. de Julio

### Cuartito

This place sells probably one of the best pizza in the town. But it is different type of pizza with thick crisp and a lot of topping. If you want the one with thin crisp, search for pizza a la piedra. We ordered one medium pizza (enough to feed one hungry person, the big one is suitable for three) and then slices of different pizzas. We really enjoyed the veggie and classic mozzarella (muzzarella in Argentina) pizza. It's very cheap and delicious option for lunch. We paid around 20-25 ARS per slice (1.7 USD), three were more then enough and 35 ARS (2.4 USD) for jarrafa (0.5 liter) of wine.  
Address:Talcahuano 937, City center, close to the Teatro Colon

### Cocina Regional 1810

We loved their food, but we hated the staff. We didn't know if we will recommend you this restaurant, but on the end this blog is about good food and budget options. Give it a try and reserve enough of time for this restaurant. They have menu with a glass of wine included from 65 ARS (4.5 USD). We wanted to try their "guisado" (stew) and empanadas so we chose the most expensive option for 100 ARS (6.6 USD). The starter are empanadas, one of the best we've tried in B.A. accompanied with spicy salsa. Andreas main course, locro, was a stew with corn, beans and choriza. Igors main course was stew with peaches (durazno), beans and two types of meat. The food was filling and satisfying in rainy day. 
We usually love service in Argentina, they are so good at it. Very attentive, professional and keen to give explanations about food. This was the worst service we experienced in B.A.. They didn't greet us when we came, the waiter didn't speak to us as at all. Even when we asked questions. Then when we wanted to pay, we had to wait twenty minutes. We asked one more time again and got sarcastic smile instead of help. We put the exact amount of money on the table and we left. They have three restaurants, in the city center, in Belgrano and in Palermo. We visited the one in the city center
Address:Marcelo T. de Alvear 868, close to the metro station General San Martin

### Abuela Goye

This ice cream chain you can find all around the city. The ice cream is very good but be prepared for higher prices (from 35 ARS for smaller portion - 2.5 USD).

## Nightlife

As we visited the Creamfields, we didn't visited many bars in the city. But we heard about clubs Pacha, Palacio Alsina or Asia de Cuba. One night we spent in Plaza Serrano, located in the Palermo district. You can find many bars, music clubs or people just drinking on the street their own alcohol. 

### The Creamfields festival 

We rushed from Bolivia, where we were very bored with their music to B.A., because of this festival. The line-up was very promising, just the main stage was full of Dutch hard style music so we skipped this stage. We enjoyed sets from Richie Hawtin, Mano Le Tough, Marcel Dettman or Sven Vath. The sound system on the second and first stage was very good, the rest a bit disappointing. We especially like sets from the resident DJ of Berghain, Marcel Dettman and Mano Le Tough. When Richie Hawtin was playing, the stage was so full that we couldn't move inside. 
The entrance was expensive, 70 USD and drinks on bar as well, 100 ARS for a beer or 80 ARS for vodka with energy drink. The organization of could also do something about the tons of mud and water in front of the second stage before the festival started. 
Party with Argentinians was a pleasure, we haven't ever experienced so polite people on electronic music festival. They know how to party, we didn't see any aggression. Everybody seemed happy and full of joy. The festival started at 16:00 pm and finished around 9:00 am. The best party in our trip.
