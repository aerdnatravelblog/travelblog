On our trip to Uyuni salt lands we stopped to see desert rabbits. They are used to people. When they hear that somebody is coming, they come out of their holes for their daily portion of fresh veggies and fruits. First very carefully observing from a distance, but after a while they eat from hand. We suppose that they choose one brave enough to go first and then rest join after him:) When Andrea approached closer one to make a pictures, thinking that they are very peaceful and forgetting that they are still wild animals, the rabbit started to make very angry faces. Yes, faces. But then when she left him alone he was driving her attention to make more pictures of him!

##About

The trip to Uyuni salt lands is very popular between travelers and photographers. Especially in the wet season (January and February) when the salt lands are changed to a huge lake, which looks like a mirror of the sky above. 
There are many agencies, operating in this area. The prices vary with the services provided. As we travel on budget, we chose cheaper option. Our guide didn't speak any English, actually didn't talk almost at all. But he was reliable driver, the car (Landcruiser Toyota) was in good condition and the food was ok (plenty of meat). For 150 USD for three days trip is a bargain. For us was also very important that they brought us to the another interest of our trip, San Pedro de Atacama, to Chile. The entrance to the parks is not included (190 BOB-27 USD). If you would like to have better service, with English speaking guide, you would have to invest double of the price. 
The tour started the first day at 11:00 am and we went to check the "train cemetery", we stopped for half an hour to make pictures. Then we moved to the salt lands, visited the cactus island and the night we spent in a salt hotel. In the hotel was hot shower for 10 BOB extra. The rooms were for three people, so we had a bit more privacy then the next day.
The second day we visited the lagoons with flamingos, observed dessert rabbits and we spent the night nearby the Laguna Colorada. We slept in a dormitory and there was no hot water, so no shower. The night was very cold. The guide told us that the sleeping bag is not necessary because it was summer. Believe us, yes you do need a sleeping bag. Although they have some blankets, but not warm enough. They rent a sleeping bag for 50 BOB (7 USD). The night sky in Laguna Colorada was amazing.
The third day we woke up at five and went to geysers, Desierto de Salvador Dali, the Green Lagoon and the White Lagoon. Then the driver left us on the bus stop to go to Chile (San Pedro de Atacama) and rest of the group head back to Uyuni. We came to San Pedro at 14:00.

## How to get to Uyuni

From Sucre take the direct bus to Uyuni, go to Potosi and change for Uyuni. We chose the direct bus. To get to terminal in Sucre, take a bus going from the Mercado close to the city center, among another ones, number 3. For the ticket to Uyuni, we paid 60 BOB p.p. (8 USD) The ride took 7 hours.

## What to do in Uyuni

You can decide for various trips to the salt lands. From one day trips to three days trips. We highly recommend you to take your time and do the longer trip, as you will see many beautiful places and not just the salt lands. 
We saw colored lakes (red lake, green lake, blue lakes with plenty of flamingos), salt lands, geysers, desert of Salvador Dali, volcanoes (one even smoking), seven colors mountain, cactus island (a dried dead coral reef where cactus started to grow) and many animals (Vicunas, desert rabbits, birds)

## San Pedro de Atacama

This small town located in the Atacama desert has a lot to offer. Sand boarding, the moon landscape, a lagoon where you can float because of the high salt content or night tours. We had just one day for San Pedro, so we could choose just one thing. They often say that the observation of the night sky is one of the best in the world so we chose the night tour.
We paid 15 000 CLP p.p. (22 USD) and we were very happy about it. The guide was very knowledgeable and we had five telescopes. We thought that the night sky will be beautiful also in the city, but because of the light pollution it wasn't possible. They took us few kilometers from San Pedro to the desert and we could see the difference. It was very beautiful but in Uyuni you can see the stars much better, that is caused by the high altitude. If you try just one restaurant, go to "La Pica del Indio". They offered us the menu del dia in the evening hours for 4.000 CLP (6 USD). We got a spinach soup, salmon with shrimps and baked sesame potatoes and a dessert. Try their Pisco sour, you won't be disappointed. They have also happy hours. The address is Tocopilla 418, just in the center.
