We partied a lot in Rio, so we wanted to take it easy on New Years Eve. We decided just go for a dinner and then watch the fireworks on Copacabana beach. However, our unusual relaxed and calm night turned to a crazy story again. We chose a Turkish restaurant, because we had enough of Mocequa and Acaraje. 
We sat down, ordered food and drinks, when Igor spotted that they have also nice selection of beers. "Yeah, we can drink one, it's nothing", we thought. They had their own brand of beers, our favorite type IPA between them. Igor stood up and went to check out on the beers from closer distance. They were placed on the top of the fridge. He had to stand on his tiptoe to reach the beers. I was just staring in to the menu, when I heard the big bang. I covered my head to don't get hurt and then I turned towards Igor and saw him staring at the halved bottle. Everybody in the restaurant stopped eating and was watching him with open mouth. Then I noticed that fan nearby him stopped spinning and I realized what happened. 
Piece of the glass were flying across the whole room. Only by a miracle they didn't hurt anybody. It just destroyed the fan. The only fan in the small restaurant, in the middle of Brazilian summer. It was 30 degrees that night and the day after 40 degrees. We left generous tips to cover at least a bit the fan, but now way they could buy a new one on 1st of January. What a beginning of the new year!

## About Rio de Janeiro

The former capital is the second largest city of Brazil. It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations—Petrobras, its leaders are now convicted from corruption and money laundering, and Vale. 
Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere. For its beaches, nature, nightlife and food is very famous among tourists. The famous landmark Christ the Redeemer is listed in the New Seven Wonders of the World. Maracana belongs between the largest football stadiums in the world. Rio will also host Summer Olympics 2016. 
The city of Rio de Janeiro was founded by the Portuguese on 1 March 1565 and was named São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro. In 1763 Rio was proclaimed as the capital city of Brazil. However, in 1960 the status was taken from Rio and the new capital became Brasilia. Interesting fact for us is that the president responsible for this dramatic change had Czech ancestors. His name was Juscelino Kubitschek.
The weather is in the summer very hot (Dec-Mar), 40 degrees temperatures aren't exceptional. There is a lot of rainfall in the summer months as well. We spent one week in Rio (Dec) and for three days we had cloudy and rainy weather. 
There is a significant difference between the poor and the rich. Large swaths of the population lives in slums (favelas). Generally, you can find the favelas on the hills. Usually tourists are scared to go there or they take a guide. We rented an apartment through Airbnb in one of the favelas close to the Copacabana beach and never had any problems. Just please check on the favela where you want to go with locals, because some of them are save but some of them not.

## Attractions

### Free walking tour

#### Copacabana and Ipanema 

Tue, Thur and Sun 15:30, meeting point Cantagalo metro station. This tour takes you to Copacabana beach, Copacabana fort, Ipanema beach, the bar where was written the famous song Girl from Ipanema and on the end the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon. The guide told us interesting stories about famous people from Rio and had an excellent English. Although it felt like he just wanted to be finished as soon as possible with the tour, because he was doing three tours in one day. 
We really liked the story about the lagoon. Rodrigo de Freitas wasn't popular or important man in Rio. He just married a girl who didn't want to get married, she was 35 and still single. She found 18 year old guy and got married. She would be super cool now!:) Her grandfather was so happy that he named the lagoon after him. 
The tour takes about 2.5 hour.

#### Downtown and Lapa

Every day, except Sun 10:30, meeting point Carioca square. This tour takes you to Colombo bakery, Imperial palace, Tiradentes palace, Cinelandia, Municipal Theater, Lapa Arches and then finish at Selaron steps. So you cover the whole downtown and important places. We weren't lucky and we got a guide with very bad English and he also acted very strange. However, we don't regret that we went. We didn't understand him much, but we made a picture about Rio and its history. 
Our favorite part was the square Cinelandia, where is Municipal Theater, National Library, City Council and also Fine Arts Museum. The Municipal Theater is probably the most beautiful building in whole Rio. They have guided visits and we heard that it is worth it. 
There is a train going from Sao Sebastian Cathedral to Santa Teresa, an artistic neighborhood. It passes the Lapa Arches also. We wanted to go with the train, but it was too overcrowded.

### Santa Teresa

This bohemian neighborhood is located next to Lapa. You can reach it also with the tram, walking is faster. We went straight to the top, where is the Parque das Ruinas. From the park is very nice view of the city. Next to the park is Museu Chacara do Ceu, the museum has a small collection of artwork from Di Cavalcanti and international artists. 
There are also some restaurants, bars, handcraft shop or galleries. We didn't visited any, but we heard that Bar do Mineiro and Cafe do Alto are very nice places to have a drink and eat something small.

### Copacabana beach

There is so much hype about Copacabana and sincerely we don't know why. The water cold and dirty. The beach is quite clean, but overcrowded. Usually we finished up in 4th or 5th row from the sea. Everything is very expensive. We paid 50 BRL for a parasol, two chairs and then 20 BRL for a Caipirinha without alcohol. We also struggled to find good and not overpriced restaurant in the Copacabana neighborhood.
Ipanema is also very overcrowded but the bars are cheaper and the neighborhood is much nicer. It is also very good place to go for a party.
However, if you are visiting during the New Years Eve party, don't miss the firework show. It was spectacular.

### Botanical garden

It is located in the Lagoa neighborhood and you can reach it with a bus. We went from Botafogo. This is good activity when the weather is not good or you want to escape from the busy city. We liked the part with medical plants and cactus garden. The entrance cost 8 BRL (2 USD) and it is opened every day 8 am - 17 pm.

### Street art

We love street art and there is plenty of them in Rio. Especially around the Botanic garden and in Botafogo. Walk from the Botanical garden toward the Lagoa and you will see plenty of it. We snapped this shots mainly on J.J. Seabra street.

### Museo Nacional de Belas Artes 

Another good and cheap activity when rains. We enjoyed the part with modern art. There are copies of important sculptures from Louvre. Unfortunately almost all descriptions are justs in Portuguese. Admission 8 BRL.

Address: Av. Rio Branco, 199 | Centro (Cinelandia)

## Food

We heard so many good things about food in Rio and we have to say that the restaurants are very over priced and we couldn't find really good ones. So we decided to mention just one. 

### Haru Sushi Bar

We were looking for good sushi restaurant for very long time. Haru Sushi is very good choice in the middle range priced restaurants around Copacabana. The sushi was very fresh and we really liked the sliced octopus. What we didn't like is that again we got also some sushi with cheese Philadelphia. Why is this so popular in Brazil? This cheese is good for a cheese cake, not for sushi. We t  90 BRL for sushi set for two (22 USD)

Address:Raimundo Correia, 10 - Copacabana

## Nightlife

There is a lot of nightlife in Rio, but the main party district is Lapa. Lapa is very close to the city center and there are also night buses. 

### Booze Bar

We had enough of Caipirinhas after more then one month in Rio and we couldn't wait to have some good beer. This was our favorite bar in Rio, they have approximately twelve beers on the tap and dozens in bottle. We love IPA beer and they had four different ones on the tap. We can not recommend the burger enough also, it was super delicious. It is more expensive place but it is worth it. The price range of beer starts on 10 BRL for a small one and goes up to 25 to a big one. The hamburger costs around 25 BRL too.

Address:Avenida Mem de Sa, 63, Lapa
