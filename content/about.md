Hi! We are a couple from Central Europe. Andrea is from Prague, Czech Republic and Igor is originally from Bratislava, Slovakia.  Both of us love to travel and explore the world. After 2.5 half years living and working in Amsterdam, we decided that it's time to pack and leave. Our big passions are food, cooking and electronic music. You may read on this topics in our posts. Furthermore we write reports on transportation, attractions and where to stay.
